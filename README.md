# Weather APP Demo

This demo weather forecast app showcases best practices in Android development. It demonstrates the implementation of the MVVM architecture pattern, Room Database, and Retrofit for API calls, utilizing Kotlin and Coroutines for efficient and modern development.

I used the https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/ endpoint to consume web APIs.
